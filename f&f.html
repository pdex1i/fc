    <i><b>Fight Club</b></i>  is a 1999 American film directed 
     by David Fincher, and starring Brad Pitt,

     discontented with his white-collar job. 
     He forms a "fight club" with soap salesman Tyler Durden (Pitt), 
    and becomes embroiled in a relationship with an impoverished but 
    beguilingly attractive woman, Marla Singer (Bonham Carter).

    The unnamed Narrator is an insomniac automobile recall specialist dissatisfied with his job and 
    lifestyle. He attends support groups for problems such as alcoholism and cancer as a substitute 
    for therapy. His efforts are disrupted when another impostor, Marla Singer, joins the same 
    groups.Viewing her as a mirror to his own deceit, he arranges for them to attend different 
    sessions, to which she reluctantly agrees.

    On a return flight from work, the Narrator meets a soap salesman, Tyler Durden, who criticizes 
    his consumerist lifestyle. After an explosion destroys the Narrator's apartment, he moves into 
    Tyler's decrepit house. They become friends and start an underground fight club in a bar 
    basement. Tyler also saves Marla from an overdose, initiating a sexual relationship between 
    them, while the Narrator remains cold to her.

    The Narrator quits his job, blackmails his boss for funds, and grows Fight Club, attracting new 
    members, including his cancer support group friend, Bob. Tyler morphs the club into Project 
    Mayhem, committing acts of vandalism intended to disrupt the social order. Feeling sidelined,
     the Narrator confronts Tyler, who admits to orchestrating the explosion in the Narrator's 
     apartment and then goes missing. When the police kill Bob during a mission, the Narrator tries 
     to dismantle Project Mayhem. Discovering its nationwide reach and being called Tyler Durden 
     by Marla and members, he realizes he and Tyler are split personalities.

     Learning that Tyler plans to erase debt records by blowing up the skyscrapers of consumer 
     credit companies, the Narrator unsuccessfully warns Marla and goes to the police, some of 
     whom are also Project Mayhem members. He attempts to disarm the explosives, but Tyler 
     attacks him. Accepting that he is Tyler, he shoots himself in the mouth, "killing" Tyler,
      while the bullet non-fatally passes through the Narrator's cheek. Marla arrives, and 
      the two hold hands as they watch the targeted buildings collapse.
